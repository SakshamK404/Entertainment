## Introduction

The Entertainment API is designed to provide developers with access to a wide range of entertainment-related data. It allows users to fetch information about movies, TV shows, music, and more.

## Features

- Retrieve information about movies, TV shows, music albums, and artists.
- Search for specific titles or artists.
- Get details such as ratings, release dates, genres, and more.
- Simple and intuitive RESTful API design.

## Installation

To use the Entertainment API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SakshamK404/Entertainment.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `Entertainment-API` directory:

   ```bash
   cd Entertainment/Entertainment-API
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash

The server will start running locally on port 3000 by default.

## Usage

Each endpoint supports GET requests with optional query parameters for searching and filtering results.
